# Digital Thermometer

Code repository for my homemade digital thermometer. 
The Mcu I'm working with right now is an AVR ATmega328p (Arduino), 
but will be moving this over to an ATTiny84 for the final board.

The board consists of 3 common cathode 7-segment displays, 3 shift registers, 
and a MAX31820 one-wire temperature sensor.
